//! Walking definitions inside the read-only Definition tab: F12 again from the
//! page on screen, and Back / Forward over the pages visited.
//!
//! The tab used to be a dead end. It showed the file F12 had landed in — a crate
//! in the registry, or std — as plain labels, with no caret to press F12 from
//! and no way back once a second definition replaced the first. Three things
//! stood in the way, and each has its own piece here:
//!
//! - **No position.** The rows are labels, and egui will not say where a label
//!   was clicked. A click now records a caret of the tab's own, which is where
//!   F12, Ctrl+F12 and Ctrl+Click ask from.
//! - **No keyboard.** A label takes no focus, so after a click in the tab NOTHING
//!   was focused — and the main editor's "nobody is focused" fallback took F12
//!   and jumped from ITS caret. The tab now owns the keyboard after a click in
//!   it (`def_owns_kbd`, read by the editor's keyboard-scope gate).
//! - **No request.** `request_definition` only builds workspace URIs. These
//!   files are asked about by the URI rust-analyzer itself reported, and never
//!   opened (see `LspState::request_goto_at_uri` for what opening one costs).
//!
//! The history is a browser's: a new jump from an older page abandons the pages
//! ahead of it. Entries are rebuilt from disk on every step rather than cached
//! whole — a view holds the entire file plus up to 600 laid-out rows, a few MB
//! on a large HAL file, where an entry is a path, two positions and an offset.
