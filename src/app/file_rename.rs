//! Renaming a project-tree file, with its module references.
//!
//! Renaming `mylib/src/radar.rs` to `radar_io.rs` must also rewrite
//! `mod radar;`, `use radar::*;` and every `radar::` path — including from
//! other crates in the workspace. Doing that by text search is not safe (a
//! dependency crate named `radar` silently shadows the module rather than
//! erroring, and `radar` occurs inside strings, comments and longer
//! identifiers), so the rewrite is asked of rust-analyzer.
//!
//! # Why `workspace/willRenameFiles`
//!
//! rust-analyzer offers two routes and they cannot be combined:
//!
//! * `textDocument/rename` on the `radar` token of `mod radar;` returns the
//!   text edits AND file-move operations, but only if the client advertises
//!   `workspaceEdit.resourceOperations` — and the IDE would then have to
//!   perform the moves itself from an LSP payload.
//! * `workspace/willRenameFiles` returns TEXT EDITS ONLY: rust-analyzer
//!   deliberately drops the file-system half, because a client that asks this
//!   question is already doing the move.
//!
//! The second is this IDE's shape exactly, so that is what is used. The cost of
//! the choice is recorded in [`crate::lsp::LspState::request_will_rename`]:
//! advertising the capability makes the first route return no text edits, which
//! is why `resourceOperations` is deliberately not advertised.
//!
//! # Ordering
//!
//! The question must be asked BEFORE the file moves — rust-analyzer resolves
//! the old path against its VFS and calls `is_dir()` on it. So a rename is a
//! two-step, asynchronous flow: ask, then (on the reply, or on a timeout) apply
//! the edits and move the file. [`PendingRename`] is that intermediate state.
