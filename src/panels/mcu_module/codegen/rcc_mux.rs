//! Per-peripheral kernel clock selection — the Clock tab's mux nodes, emitted.
//!
//! A modern STM32 gives most peripherals their own clock selector: USART1SEL,
//! I2C1SEL, ADCSEL, LPTIM1SEL. The Clock tab has ALWAYS shown these — a CubeMX
//! import of a WBA55 carries 16 of them, an H5 thirty — and the user could pick
//! a source and watch the frequency change. None of it reached `main.rs`:
//! [`codegen_node_ids`](super::rcc::codegen_node_ids) listed only bus and PLL
//! nodes, so nothing bound them and nothing read them. A diagram that computed
//! an answer nobody asked the compiler.
//!
//! # Nothing here is guessed
//!
//! Emitting one line needs three names:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! config.rcc.mux.usart1sel = mux::Usart1sel::HSI;
//! //             ^field           ^enum      ^variant
//! ```
//!
//! and the enum is NOT the field capitalised: on WBA, `usart2sel` and
//! `usart3sel` both use `Usartsel`, while `i2c2sel` and `i2c4sel` both use
//! `I2c1sel`. So the table is harvested from `stm32-metapac`'s register IR —
//! the same data embassy's own build script reads — by
//! `scripts/harvest-rcc-mux.py`, into [`rcc_mux_data`](super::rcc_mux_data).
//!
//! # Proposed by name, CONFIRMED by sources
//!
//! Matching a node to a selector by name alone would be a guess of the kind
//! this module exists to avoid, so a proposal only survives if the tree agrees
//! with the register: input *i* of the mux must be fed by the clock metapac
//! names for register value *i*. `USART1Mult` is fed by `APB2Prescaler`,
//! `SysCLKOutput`, `HSIRC`, `LSEOSC`; `Usart1sel` reads `PCLK2`, `SYS`, `HSI`,
//! `LSE`. Four for four, in order, so that binding is real.
//!
//! When they disagree — a vendor tree that orders its inputs differently, a
//! selector the tree does not model — the node is DROPPED. A missing line
//! leaves the peripheral on its reset clock, which is what happened before this
//! module existed. A wrong line silently runs a peripheral off the wrong clock.
