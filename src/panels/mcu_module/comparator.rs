//! Analog comparators (COMP) — the Configuration tab's second peripheral.
//!
//! # Why it lives here and not on the Pins canvas
//!
//! A comparator is half pin-less. Its non-inverting input IS a pin, and that
//! pin is chosen the ordinary way (`COMP{n}_INP` on the Pins tab). Everything
//! else — the reference it compares against, hysteresis, power mode, output
//! polarity — is a register with no pin at all, exactly like a watchdog's
//! period. So the pin comes from the canvas and the settings from a card here,
//! and the card refuses to generate anything until the pin exists.
//!
//! # Why STM32G4 only
//!
//! `embassy_stm32::comp` implements `Instance` under `#[cfg(comp_v2)]` and
//! `#[cfg(comp_u5)]` and nowhere else. Counted across `stm32-metapac 21`, that
//! is 93 chips (the whole G4 family) and 105 (U5 + WBA) out of the 1522 that
//! have a comparator at all — L4's `v3`, H7's `h7_b`, G0's `v1` and the rest
//! have registers in the PAC but no driver.
//!
//! Worse for the F3 that raised the question: `STM32F303`/`F358` list COMP1..7
//! as peripherals in metapac with `registers: None` — no register block at all,
//! so nothing can be generated for them without new data upstream.
//!
//! Both generations are supported here, and they are NOT the same peripheral:
//!
//! | | `comp_v2` (G4) | `comp_u5` (U5, WBA) |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | instances | COMP1..7 (COMP1..4 on a G431) | COMP1, COMP2 |
//! | hysteresis | 8 steps, 10..70 mV | 4 levels, None/Low/Medium/High |
//! | `[-]` pin | INM1 and INM2 | INM1 only |
//! | speed / power | **not written by embassy** | written |
//! | interrupt | `COMP1_2_3` / `COMP4_5_6` / `COMP7` | one vector, `COMP` |
//!
//! The power-mode row is the one worth pausing on: `Config::power_mode` exists
//! on both, but `configure_raw` only writes it under `#[cfg(comp_u5)]`. Showing
//! it on a G4 would be a setting the driver silently drops, so it is hidden
//! there — the same rule that keeps Trigger Mode and Output Internal Selection
//! off the card.
